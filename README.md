# Testing Flutter Project
This is a simple project that tells the no. of month when clicked on check button and clears the entered value. But, there are test Cases written for the fuctions, Widgets and the flow.

### Unit Testing
Unit testing is a software testing technique that focuses on testing individual units or components of a software system. A unit can be a function, method, or class. The purpose of unit testing is to validate that each unit of code works correctly in isolation. It involves writing test cases to exercise specific functionalities or behaviors of the unit and comparing the actual output with the expected output. Unit testing helps in identifying and fixing bugs early in the development process, provides a safety net for refactoring, and improves the overall quality and maintainability of the code.

### Widget Testing
Widget testing, also known as component testing or UI testing, is a type of testing that specifically focuses on testing user interface components or widgets of a software application. Widgets can include graphical elements such as buttons, input fields, dropdowns, menus, etc. Widget testing involves simulating user interactions with the widgets and verifying that the expected behavior is exhibited. It ensures that the user interface components are correctly rendered, respond appropriately to user actions, and display the expected data or content. Widget testing is particularly useful for catching visual defects, layout issues, and UI-related bugs.

### Integration Testing 
Integration testing is a software testing approach that aims to test the interactions and integration between different modules or components of a software system. It involves combining individual units or modules that have already been tested in isolation and testing them as a group. The purpose of integration testing is to ensure that the integrated components work together correctly and meet the expected functionality and requirements. Integration testing helps in identifying issues related to communication between modules, data exchange, dependencies, and overall system behavior. It can be used to test different types of integrations, such as module-to-module integration, system-to-system integration, or third-party integration. Integration testing is crucial for detecting defects and ensuring the overall system stability and reliability.

## Getting started with App
There are several test cases written for Unit, Widget and Integration testing.
